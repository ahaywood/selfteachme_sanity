            <li><strong>Anyone can learn how to code.</strong> Yes, sometimes you want to pull your hair out and, yes, some days are easier than others. But, I believe you can.</li>

It has changed the way I think about problems, not to mention, I was able to expand my offerings, provide a one-stop web design and development shop, and stay at home with my babies.</li>
            <li><strong>The sky is the limit.</strong> When you know how to code, you can build anything you want: a web application, an app for your phone, or your own website. If you can think it, you can build.</li>
            <li><strong>Designers that can code are better designers.</strong> I know that‚Äôs probably a controversial statement, but I believe anytime you‚Äôre creating, the better you understand the medium, its limitations, and sweet spots, the more proficient you‚Äôll be at using it. </li>
            <li><strong>There‚Äôs something magical about being able to execute an idea from conception to completion</strong>: discovery to design to development to deployment. I love seeing an idea come to fruition, exactly as you envisioned it.</li>

            I‚Äôve worked in a variety of settings: a small business of 10-15, a medium sized company of 70, an internal team for a large corporation of 1,000+,  a freelancer, and ran the show at my own agency.  I understand the pitfalls and joys, triumphs and struggles of each.

            Throughout the years, I‚Äôve built hundreds of websites, ranging from custom web applications, brochure marketing sites, eCommerce, and Membership sites. I‚Äôve designed and developed for multi-million dollar brands and small, lean start-ups.

            When I was a senior in high school, I took a web development class to meet my computer requirements to graduate. Halfway through the year, my teacher was diagnosed with a brain tumor. They couldn‚Äôt find a substitute that knew the material. My teacher asked me to teach the class in exchange for an automatic A.

          <p>When I was in 8th grade, I built my first website, using Netscape Navigator‚Äôs web tools. I decided it would be a good idea to pull all the animated gifs on the Internet and put them in one central location. With so many animated images, my site was enough to give anyone a seizure. Let‚Äôs not even talk about file size and load times. But, I like to believe that I was before my time. Curated content and animated gifs anyone? Sounds like today‚Äôs <a href="http://giphy.com" target="_blank">Giphy</a>! -- And I still have a soft spot in my heart for a good animated gif.</p>
          <p>I graduated from college in 2006 from Middle Tennessee State University with a degree in Radio / TV Broadcasting and a concentration in Animation.</p>

It‚Äôs still fun to name drop in conversations. (*Cough* Janet Jackson, Taylor Swift, Kelly Clarkson, Counting Crows, Ice Cube, and Kanye West ‚Äî just to name a few). I worked there for a year, before going to LifeWay. It was a good thing, too, because two months after I left, Ticketmaster dissolved echo.</p></div>
